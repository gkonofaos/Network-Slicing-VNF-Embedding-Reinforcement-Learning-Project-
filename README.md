# Network-Slicing-VNF-Embedding-Reinforcement-Learning-Project-

## Network Slicing & VNF Embedding â€“ Reinforcement Learning Project

### Overview

This project explores dynamic placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on cloud servers using reinforcement learning. The aim is to minimize SLA violations, node power usage, and migration costs.

The repository contains:

Phase 1 Report: MDP modeling and Policy Iteration for small-scale networks.

Phase 2 Report: Tabular Q-learning and Deep RL approaches for larger networks.

Final.ipynb: Complete Python implementation combining simulation and experiments.
